# Image-Classification

Image classification is a method of classification based on the statistics in this image. It is a subset of Deep Learning. This Project focuses on classification on images using CNN.CNN is a convolutional neural network which is a part of Machine Learning. Using Convolutional neural networks we can classified images with high Accuracy From CIFAR dataset in less time.
